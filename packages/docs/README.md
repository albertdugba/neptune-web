# Neptune Web Docs

Neptune is the Design System built by and used at TransferWise. Neptune Web is the Neptune framework for Web. Neptune Web provides a way to build high quality, consistent user experiences on the web with ease.

This is the Neptune Web Documentation website. See the [live site](https://transferwise.github.io/neptune-web)

## CSS in JS

We are using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) to write css styles with JavaScript in some of the components implemented for the documentation. The primary way to style elements with emotion is the [css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop). As we are already using a React version that has [the new JSX runtimes](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) you have to set the [jsx pragma](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#jsx-pragma) at the top of your source file that uses the `css` prop as the following.

```javascript
/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */
```
