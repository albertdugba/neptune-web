# Neptune Web React Components

Neptune is the Design System built by and used at TransferWise. Neptune Web is the Neptune framework for Web. Neptune Web provides a way to build high quality, consistent user experiences on the web with ease.

This is the Neptune Web React component library. It uses [Neptune CSS](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/tree/main/packages/css).

## Usage

Neptune Components are published to npm as [@transferwise/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@transferwise/components).

Install `@transferwise/components` and its peer dependencies. **Note:** currency-flags is only required if you're using the [Money Input](https://transferwise.github.io/neptune-web/components/MoneyInput) or if you're using flags on the [Select](https://transferwise.github.io/neptune-web/components/Select).

```
# yarn
yarn add @transferwise/components react react-dom prop-types currency-flags

# npm
npm install @transferwise/components react react-dom prop-types currency-flags
```

```js
// These CSS files should be imported once in your application
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune.css';
import '@transferwise/components/build/main.css';

import en from '@transferwise/components/build/i18n/en.json';
import { Provider, Button, Size } from '@transferwise/components';

export default function Hello() {
  return (
    <Provider i18n={{ locale: 'en-UK', messages: en }}>
      <Button size={Size.SMALL} block={true}>
        Hello Neptune
      </Button>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

### TypeScript | Type Declarations

This package exposes [type declarations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html) for all components.

Note: types for some of components are not 100% accurate (some of them will be just [`any`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#any)), this is due to fact that many of components written on JavaScript and types generated by [react-to-typescript-definitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-typescript-definitions) based of components `PropTypes` and unfortunatly the library doesn't resolve all `PropTypes` features and use cases (e.g custom validators, `PropTypes.objectOf`, [requireIf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-required-if), etc). But bear with us as eventually it would be fully on TypeScript.

Please follow [rules for JS components](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/blob/main/packages/components/CONTRIBUTING.md#js-component-rules) in order to generate accurate types for them.
